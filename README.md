# Superstore Sales Dashboard – Tableau Project

## 📊 Overview
This project was developed for **BUS 351: Introduction to Business Analytics** at NC State University. The objective was to create an interactive and visually compelling dashboard in Tableau that allows a Sales Manager to track sales performance across the United States.

The dataset simulates a real-world scenario for "Superstore," a Canadian retailer that has expanded into the U.S. Each state has a designated sales agent, and the Sales Manager needs a tool to monitor their performance and make data-driven decisions.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Monitor **Sales Agent performance** across U.S. states.
- Analyze **sales growth** over a user-selected time frame.
- Provide **breakdowns of sales by category** and **top-performing products**.
- Ensure **interactivity**, allowing the user to filter by date range and dynamically update the entire dashboard.

## 💻 Tools Used
- **Tableau** (Packaged Workbook `.twbx`)
- Superstore dataset (included within Tableau workbook)

## ✅ Features
- 📈 **Sales Growth Tracker**: Visualizes changes in sales over custom timeframes.
- 👤 **Sales Agent Performance**: Compares performance across different agents and states.
- 🗂️ **Category Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of product categories and subcategories.
- 🏆 **Top Products**: Highlights best-selling products during selected timeframes.
- 📅 **Timeframe Filter**: A global filter that updates all visuals based on date selections.
- 🧭 **Map Integration** (if applicable): Geographical display of regional sales trends.
- 🎨 **Professional Aesthetics**: Clean layout with proper spacing, centered titles, consistent fonts, and appropriate use of the Superstore logo.

## 📦 Deliverables
- `Project 2 BUS 351 Final.twbx`: A Tableau Packaged Workbook containing all visualizations and dashboards.
- Optional documentation (if provided) explaining the dashboard components and insights.

## 🏁 Outcome
This project demonstrates core Tableau competencies, including dashboard design, interactivity, and effective communication of business insights — all of which are highly applicable in business analytics roles.
